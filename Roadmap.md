First version to consider making a release must have these features:

- [x] Configurable adapters to MySQL, Psql and SQLite
- [x] Storable config in a "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/datapie/datapie.toml" file
- [x] Run query -> catch errors -> see results in Table View
- [x] App is refactored with Textual good practices (Messages, Reactive attributes for Widgets, different Screens)


## 0.1.1 version

- [ ] Add Github workflows
- [ ] Export to CSV entire Table View
- [ ] Select entire rows using V in Table View
- [ ] Export to CSV only selected rows from Table View

## 0.1.2 version

- [ ] Create a "Command Mode" for the Table View that enables selections and edits using vim-like regex and persists any changes to DB
