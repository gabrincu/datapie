# Roadmap for Datapie

## 0.1 version

First version to consider making a release must have these features:

- [ ] Configurable adapters to MySQL, Psql and SQLite
- [ ] Storable config in a "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/datapie/connections.toml" file
- [ ] Easy way to jump around the panels using vim keys (h, j, k, l)
- [ ] Run query -> catch errors -> see results in table view -> Export results to csv
- [ ] App is refactored with Textual good practices (Messages, Reactive attributes for Widgets, different Screens)
